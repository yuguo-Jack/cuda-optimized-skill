# cuda-kernel-optimizer

**English** | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

A Claude skill that iteratively optimizes a CUDA / CUTLASS / Triton kernel against a Python reference, using `nsight-compute` (`ncu`) as the source of evidence for each optimization decision.

Hygon DCU / HIP migration is available under `skills/hyhon-hip-kernel-optimizer`; see [README.hyhon-hip-kernel-optimizer.md](README.hyhon-hip-kernel-optimizer.md) for Codex usage, remote validation, `hipprof`, `dccobjdump`, and CK Tile notes.

If you only have a Torch/Triton/TileLang reference and shape, use `skills/hygon-hip-baseline-generator` first. It scaffolds a correctness-first Hygon HIP baseline before the iterative optimizer takes over.

This is a **skill package**, not a standalone tool. Claude reads `SKILL.md` and drives the loop. The scripts under `scripts/` handle the deterministic parts (environment detection, profiling, benchmarking, state).

## Usage
```text
Use this prompt in the agent:
@cuda-kernel-optimizer use this skill to optimize "the operator you want to optimize" for N iterations.
```

## What's new in V2

V2 upgrades the loop from "try-and-log" into "try–attribute–verify–learn". Four mechanisms are added on top of V1; everything below reflects V2 behavior:

- **Roofline-driven axis budget** — instead of V1's fixed 1-method-per-axis, V2 computes per-iteration compute/memory/latency gaps (Δc, Δm, Δl) and splits the 3-method budget proportionally (per-axis cap = 2). When all three gaps fall below 0.15 the loop early-stops with `near_peak: true`.
- **Branch-and-Select exploration** — each iteration generates K branch candidates (default K=4) sharing the same methods but varying tile size, pipeline stages, warp count, and implementation variants. The fastest correct branch wins as champion; the rest are archived in `frontier`.
- **Ablation-based attribution** — after the champion is picked, each method is ablated one at a time. `attribution(m) = ms_without_m − ms_champion` gives a per-method causal contribution instead of a single packed verdict.
- **SASS instruction-level verification** — `cuobjdump --dump-sass` is grepped against a signature table (`sass_signatures.json`) to confirm each claimed optimization actually appears in the compiled machine code.

These together change method classification from two buckets (effective / ineffective) to three: `effective_methods` (SASS ✓ and attribution > noise), `ineffective_methods` (SASS ✓ but attribution ≤ noise), and `implementation_failed_methods` (SASS ✗).

## What you need

On the host where Claude runs:

- A CUDA GPU with working drivers (`nvidia-smi` works)
- `nvcc` in `$PATH` (for CUDA / CUTLASS backends)
- `ncu` in `$PATH` with permission to read perf counters — without it, the skill degrades to code-static reasoning only, which is significantly weaker
- `cuobjdump` in `$PATH` (ships with the CUDA toolkit) — needed for V2's SASS verification step
- Python 3.10+ with `torch` (CUDA build), `triton` if you want the Triton backend
- For CUTLASS kernels: `$CUTLASS_PATH` or `$CUTLASS_INCLUDE_DIR` pointing at a tree with both `cutlass/` and `cute/` headers

`benchmark.py` (the generic operator benchmark driver) is bundled at `scripts/benchmark.py` — no separate installation needed.

### `ncu` permission gotcha

On most cloud and container setups, profiling-counter access is disabled. You'll see it as `can_read_counters: false` in `env.json`. Fixes (pick one):

- Run the host as root, or
- Add `options nvidia NVreg_RestrictProfilingToAdminUsers=0` to `/etc/modprobe.d/nvidia.conf` and reboot, or
- For docker: `--cap-add=SYS_ADMIN` (Nsight docs recommend this)

## What you give Claude

1. **Baseline kernel file** — `gemm.cu` (CUDA/CUTLASS) or `gemm.py` (Triton)
2. **Reference file** — `ref.py` exposing `reference(**kwargs)` and optional `atol` / `rtol`
3. **Dims** — the scalar args the signature takes (e.g. `M=4096 N=4096 K=4096`)
4. **Path to `benchmark.py`** — already bundled under `scripts/benchmark.py`; `orchestrate.py` defaults to it. Pass `--benchmark <path>` only if you have a custom version.
5. Optional: iteration count `N` (default 3), `ncu_num` per-axis top-K (default 5), noise threshold (default 2%), **branches per iteration `K` (default 4, via `--branches`)**

## What you get back

A sibling directory of your baseline, `run_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/`, containing:

## Manual invocation

You don't need to drive the loop by hand — that's Claude's job — but for debugging the skill itself:

```bash
# 0 + 0b + 1 + 2 + 3a-for-iter1
python scripts/orchestrate.py setup \
  --baseline   ./gemm.cu \
  --ref        ./ref.py \
  --iterations 3 \
  --ncu-num    5 \
  --branches   4 \
  --dims       '{"M":4096,"N":4096,"K":4096}'
  # --benchmark defaults to scripts/benchmark.py (bundled)

# --- (Claude writes iterv1/kernel.cu + iterv1/methods.json + iterv1/analysis.md
#      + K branch candidates under iterv1/branches/) ---

# 3d + 3f + 3a-for-iter2 for iter 1
# close-iter now also runs: branch selection → SASS check → ablation → state update
python scripts/orchestrate.py close-iter \
  --run-dir   run_20260418_143022 \
  --iter      1
  # --benchmark defaults to scripts/benchmark.py (bundled)

# (repeat code-gen + close-iter for iter 2 and iter 3)

# 4
python scripts/orchestrate.py finalize --run-dir run_20260418_143022
```

Each script is independently invocable (`--help` on any of them); `orchestrate.py` is just a convenience wrapper.

## How Claude uses this

When a user says "optimize `gemm.cu`", Claude:

1. reads `SKILL.md`
2. calls `orchestrate.py setup` (which runs env check → preflight → init → seed baseline → first profile)
3. reads `iterv1/ncu_top.json` and the current best kernel source
4. **runs `roofline.py` to get Δc / Δm / Δl and the per-axis method budget (total = 3, per-axis cap = 2); if `near_peak: true`, the loop ends here**
5. consults `references/optimization_catalog.md` + `references/ncu_metrics_guide.md`
6. picks methods **under the axis budget** (budget-aware scan: skip axis if budget=0, pick top-N by `trigger_strength` if budget=2), writes them + reasoning to `iterv1/methods.json` and `iterv1/analysis.md`
7. writes **K branch candidates** to `iterv1/branches/b{0..K-1}/kernel.<ext>` — same methods, different hyperparameters (tile / stages / warps / impl variants)
8. calls `orchestrate.py close-iter --iter 1`, which internally:
   - runs `branch_explore.py` → compiles + benchmarks all branches, elects the fastest correct one as champion (copied to `iterv1/kernel.<ext>`), archives the rest in `frontier`
   - profiles the champion with `ncu` → `iterv1/kernel.ncu-rep`
   - runs `sass_check.py` → `iterv1/sass_check.json`
   - runs `ablate.py` → `iterv1/attribution.json`
   - updates state: each method lands in one of `effective_methods` / `ineffective_methods` / `implementation_failed_methods` based on SASS ✓/✗ × attribution > noise
9. on correctness failure (all K branches fail): inspects `bench.json.correctness` + `bench.stderr.txt`, rewrites the kernel, retries (up to 3×)
10. on success: `best_file` advances if faster; `roofline_history` is appended
11. loops back to step 3 for the next iteration
12. calls `orchestrate.py finalize` and writes a retrospective into `summary.md` — including the bottleneck drift table sourced from `roofline_history`

See `examples/walkthrough.md` for a full example and `SKILL.md` for the formal procedure.

## Limits and honest caveats

- **Ceiling**: if your reference is already cuBLAS / cuDNN / cuBLASLt, meaningful wins require algorithmic changes (split-K, stream-K, fused epilogues, mixed precision) that Claude may or may not find in a 3-iteration budget. Large speedups are easier when the baseline is hand-rolled.
- **Noise**: kernels running under ~50 μs are dominated by launch overhead. The skill's default 2% noise threshold helps, but if your dims are tiny, raise `--repeat` or the dimensions. Ablation attribution uses the same threshold — sub-noise contributions are classified as `ineffective_methods`.
- **Triton + `@triton.autotune`**: autotuning under `ncu` is slow and can time out. Either pre-bake a single config before profiling, or set `--launch-count 1` and increase warmup.
- **ncu CSV column names**: older `ncu` (< 2022.1) emits `"Metric Value"` with different capitalization/units; `profile_ncu.py` is tolerant but if you see all zeros check the `.ncu.log` file in the iteration directory.
- **Branch cost**: with K=4 and ablation, each iteration compiles up to K + (num_methods) kernels. On a fresh build this can be slow; lower `--branches` if wall-clock matters more than exploration.
- **SASS signatures are heuristic**: `sass_signatures.json` greps for instruction patterns, not full semantic equivalence. A method can pass the grep but still be implemented suboptimally — attribution is what catches that.
- **Retries are bounded**: after 3 correctness failures on one iteration, the skill moves on and records the attempt as failed rather than looping forever. A kernel that can't be made correct after 3 tries usually has a conceptual issue that needs human review.

## Example result

Using the Batch Normalization problem from Tensara as an example, this project demonstrates a substantial performance improvement from a baseline implementation to an optimized kernel. After submission to the A100-80GB environment, the solution passed 4/4 test cases successfully. The average runtime dropped from 82.94 ms to 439.13 μs, while throughput increased dramatically from 2.52 GFLOPS to 476.20 GFLOPS. It is worth noting that most development and tuning were carried out locally on an RTX 3060, so local measurements cannot fully reflect the upper-bound performance achievable on an A100. Therefore, the final benchmark results should be based on the platform’s A100 evaluation, which better highlights the impact of careful kernel optimization and implementation details.
